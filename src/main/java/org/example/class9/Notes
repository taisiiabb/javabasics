Arrays
    Array is a set of values that is characterized by a single data type and are arranged by specified dimensions
    Are collections of multiple variables
    These variables have indexes which help us retrieve
    and store data inside the array

Why we should we use Array:
    When we have a lot of data storing it inside of the variables is not feasible.

Syntax:
    Approach 1:
    Datatype [] ArrayName = new DataType[Size];
    int [] numbers = new int[5];

    Approach 2:
    Datatype [] ArrayName = { element1, element2, element3, element4}
    int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 45, 50};
Enhanced for loop:
    Enhanced for loop is a simplified version of normal for loop where the elements are pulled from the array
automatically one by one. There is no index involved in this type of loop.

Nested Loops:
